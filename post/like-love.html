        <h1>💘 Liking Someone vs Loving Someone. The Confusing Mess Explained</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">By Pawan Limbu 💌</p>

        <div class="story-body">

          <p>Ever been stuck at 2 AM thinking, “Wait… do I like them or do I love them?”
            Yeah. Me too. <br>
            And honestly, the line between “I like you” and “I love you” is thinner than you think.
          </p>

          <p>So let’s break it down without the therapy jargon, without pretending we’re all emotionally stable (we’re
            not).
          </p>

          <h2>What “liking someone” actually feels like</h2>
          <p>When you like someone, it’s light. Fun. <br>
            You catch yourself smiling at their messages, stalking their Instagram just a tiny bit, and maybe daydreaming
            about random stuff like going on late-night drives or matching outfits.
          </p>

          <p>You like the idea of them. <br>
            You like how they make you feel — that dopamine rush when your phone lights up with their name.
          </p>

          <p>But here’s the deal: liking someone doesn’t demand anything heavy. <br>
            It’s “I like you around me” energy, not “I’ll stay when things fall apart” energy.
          </p>

          <div class="article-img">
            <img src="../style/images/lvl2.webp" alt="The stage where even a ‘hey’ feels like poetry" />
          </div>

          <p>Liking is when you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wanna look your best when they’re around</li>
            <li>Feel happy when they text first</li>
            <li>Don’t tell them you cried over a math assignment yesterday</li>
            <li>Would rather talk about memes than trauma</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It’s basically the crush phase — all sparkle, zero tax.</p>

          <h2>And then… loving someone hits different</h2>
          <p>Love isn’t loud. It’s quieter. <br>
            It’s when you stop performing and just exist around someone. <br>
            It’s when you don’t care if your hair looks like a bird’s nest because they’ve already seen worse and still
            stayed.
          </p>

          <div class="article-img">
            <img src="../style/images/lvl3.webp" alt="Love isn’t loud — it just stays." />
          </div>

          <p>When you love someone — <br>
            you start caring about their mental peace as much as yours. <br>
            You stop thinking about what they bring to your life <br>
            and start thinking about how you can make theirs better.
          </p>

          <p>It’s messy. <br>
            It’s late-night arguments followed by “don’t sleep angry.” <br>
            It’s “I’ll still text you even if I’m mad” energy.
          </p>
          <p><i><em>Love is not fireworks. It’s a warm lamp when the power goes out.</em></i></p>

          <h2>Quick comparison</h2>
          <div class="table-container">
            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Situation</th>
                  <th>Liking</th>
                  <th>Loving</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>They take hours to reply</td>
                  <td>“Ugh maybe they lost interest 😭”</td>
                  <td>“They’re probably busy, it’s okay.”</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>You hang out</td>
                  <td>You plan outfits</td>
                  <td>You show up in pajamas</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>They’re upset</td>
                  <td>You panic</td>
                  <td>You listen</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>They’re annoying</td>
                  <td>You get ick</td>
                  <td>You still adore them</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>They fail</td>
                  <td>You comfort for a bit</td>
                  <td>You stay and help rebuild</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>

          <p>See the pattern? <br>
            Liking is feeling nice. <br>
            Loving is being kind.
          </p>

          <h2>So why does this matter?</h2>
          <p>Because we all confuse butterflies with roots. <br>
            Butterflies are cute... they flutter, they make your stomach do flips. <br>
            But roots? They keep things alive. <br>
            And love is more roots than butterflies.
          </p>

          <div class="article-img">
            <img src="../style/images/lvl4.webp" alt="Butterflies fade. Roots stay." />
          </div>

          <p>If you chase only butterflies, every new person feels like “the one” until they’re not. <br>
            But when love shows up, it’s boring sometimes. <br>
            And that’s how you know it’s real.
          </p>

          <h2>The grey zone: “I like them but I think I’m starting to love them”</h2>
          <p>This is the emotional purgatory no one prepares you for. <br>
            You’re not obsessed anymore, but you care too much to walk away. <br>
            You still get nervous before seeing them, but you also wanna tell them about the weird dream you had about
            ducks.
          </p>

          <div class="article-img">
            <img src="../style/images/lvl5.webp" alt="That in-between stage where your brain and heart keep arguing." />
          </div>

          <p>That’s the transition phase. <br>
            If it’s healthy, it slowly shifts into comfort and care. <br>
            If it’s not, it fizzles. <br>
            And that’s fine too. Not every spark needs to turn into a wildfire.
          </p>

          <h2>Real talk</h2>
          <p>Love isn’t a feeling that just happens. <br>
            It’s a choice you keep making to stay, to care, to grow.
          </p>

          <p>Liking is a feeling. <br>
            Loving is an effort.
          </p>

          <p>If you ever find someone who gives you both — <br>
            someone who makes you laugh and feels like home — <br>
            don’t overthink it. Just hold on. Or maybe wait for the right time :)
          </p>

          <h2>So what now?</h2>
          <p>Ask yourself:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Do I like how they make me feel?</li>
            <li>Or do I love who they are, even when they’re not making me feel good?</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="article-img">
            <img src="../style/images/lvl6.webp" alt="Love isn’t fireworks. It’s a lamp that stays." />
          </div>

          <p>If the second one hits harder, congrats. You’ve crossed the line. <br>
            If not, that’s okay. Not everything needs to turn into love. <br>
            Sometimes, liking is enough. It’s still beautiful.
          </p>

          <p>Still confused about the whole liking vs loving thing? Chill, here are some quick answers ↓</p>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>Q1: How do I know if I like someone or love them?</strong></summary>
            <p>If their happiness matters even when you gain nothing from it — that’s love.
              But if you mostly enjoy the attention and fun vibes, that’s liking.
              Basically, love stays when the butterflies leave.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>Q2: Can liking someone turn into love?</strong></summary>
            <p>Absolutely yes. Every big love story starts with a tiny “I kinda like them” moment.
              When liking turns into comfort, care, and calm — that’s your upgrade to love.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>Q3: Is liking someone bad or immature?</strong></summary>
            <p>Nope. Liking is beautiful too — it’s light, warm, and sometimes that’s all we need.
              Not every connection has to be a grand love story; some are just small, happy chapters.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>Q4: How does love feel different from a crush?</strong></summary>
            <p>A crush gives you butterflies and chaos. <br>
              Love gives you peace and patience. <br>
              One burns fast, the other glows steady.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>Q5: How long does it take for liking to become love?</strong></summary>
            <p>There’s no timer on it. It happens slowly — through shared laughs, small fights,
              and those “you okay?” texts that come when you least expect. Love just kind of sneaks up and stays.
            </p>
