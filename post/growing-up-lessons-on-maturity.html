                <p class="subtitle">By Pawan Limbu ..... just another confused human on the internet.</p>

                <div class="story-body">

                    <p>
                        I’m here again with some interesting (or boring, depends on how you see it) stories.
                        Who here thinks, “Yeah, I’m mature”? 🤔
                        I used to think that too. Turns out..... I was very wrong. Like, embarrassingly wrong.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Truth is, no one is actually mature enough to have all the answers. Everyone’s just figuring
                        things out while pretending they know what they are doing.
                        And no, I’m not here to drop some heavy life advice or act wise or anything. I just wanna share
                        some of the things I’ve slowly realised along the way.
                    </p>



                    <h2>Growing Up Isn’t What I Thought 🚀</h2>

                    <p>
                        When I was a kid, I always looked at older people and felt jealous. They could go out whenever
                        they wanted, stay late, roam around without getting scolded.
                        Meanwhile, my mom had strict timings for me just to go play. If I even tried sneaking out in the
                        evening, punishment was guaranteed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Back then I kept thinking, “When I grow up, no one can stop me.”
                        And now..... I’m 18 and I finally have that so called freedom.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Funny thing is, I don’t even want to go out anymore.
                        I’ve got stuff to do, responsibilities, things to think about (even though most of the time I
                        just lie on my bed doing absolutely nothing 🛏️).
                        I started realising how important time is ⏳ though I still waste it like a professional.
                        I also started thinking home is where the real peace is 🕊️
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For a moment I thought, “Okay, now I’m mature.”
                        But nah..... this is just level 1. There’s still a long way to go.
                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <h2>Lesson 1: Freedom isn’t just fun 🎢</h2>

                    <p>
                        The freedom I always dreamed of does not feel as light as I imagined.
                        Every choice now feels like it actually matters.
                        Staying out late, what I choose to do, what I don’t do..... everything has consequences.
                        It is like freedom but with a bill attached to it.
                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <h2>Should I Tell Them or Not? 🤷‍♂️</h2>

                    <p>
                        This one always messes with my head.
                        Someone asks, “How do I look in this?” 👗
                        And you know deep down it is not looking good, but you still say, “Yeah, you look great,” just
                        to avoid awkwardness.
                    </p>

                        </p>
                    </div>


                    <p>
                        I do this a lot.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I remember a friend of mine who loves writing and making rap songs 🎤.
                        One day he asked me to listen to one of his tracks and tell him honestly how it was.
                        It was not terrible, but it definitely needed improvement.
                        But I did not have the guts to say that. I just said, “It is nice bro.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        He kept making similar songs and I kept feeling guilty because maybe if I had been honest, he
                        could’ve actually improved.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have friends who can just say things directly to people’s faces and I honestly do not know how
                        they do it.
                        Sometimes I even feel jealous of that confidence.
                        But slowly I’m learning that honesty, even when it hurts, matters more than fake comfort.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Lesson 2: Truth hurts, but lies stay longer 💔</h2>

                    <p>
                        Being honest is not easy. It can make things awkward, emotional, even messy.
                        But in the long run, it is better than smiling and hiding how you really feel.
                    </p>



                    <h2>YTF Did I Do That? 🤦‍♂️</h2>

                    <p>
                        You ever replay something in your head and go,
                        “Why the hell did I do that?”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Yeah..... same.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I’ve done things I still cringe about.
                        I even once fought with a teacher back in school, which still feels unreal when I think about it
                        now.
                        And that is just one example. There are plenty of moments where my past self clearly had no
                        brain connection.
                    </p>
                    <!-- IMAGE 5: Regret / Cringe Memory -->
                    <div class="article-img">
                        <img src="../style/images/growing up (4).webp"

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        That sentence keeps looping in my mind sometimes:
                        “Y.....T.....F DID I DO THAT?”
                    </p>

                    <h2>Lesson 3: Regret is painful, but it teaches 🌱</h2>

                    <p>
                        Regret sucks. It makes you uncomfortable, embarrassed, and sometimes keeps you awake at night.
                        But it also shows you that you’re growing.
                        Every stupid decision, every awkward moment, every bad choice..... they all leave behind a small
                        lesson.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So yeah, these are some of the important lessons I’ve learned so far.
                        There are more, obviously, but if I start writing all of them, I might finish this tomorrow ☻
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Life feels like a long road where you keep tripping, standing up, acting confident, failing
                        again, and then laughing about it later.
                        I’m still learning, still messing up, still trying to understand myself.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you relate to any of this, then maybe we’re all just confused together.
                        And honestly, that feels kinda comforting.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So yeah, these are just a few lessons I’ve picked up so far while trying to survive my own
                        thoughts and decisions.
                        I know I’ll still mess up, still overthink, still say the wrong things at the wrong time.
                        But maybe that is how growing actually works. Not perfect, not smooth..... just real.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I’m still figuring things out, step by step, mistake by mistake.
                        And maybe one day I’ll look back at this and laugh..... or cringe a little more.
                        Either way, this is where I am right now, and I guess that is okay.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you made it till the end, thanks for staying with my chaos for a while.
                        Till next time..... take care of yourself, yeah?
