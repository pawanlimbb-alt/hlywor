                <div class="story-body">
                    <p>Dear reader,</p>
                    <p>
                        I am here to share my life experience ‚Äî a story about my first love.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once upon a time, we were all afraid to have a boyfriend or girlfriend. But look at us now ‚Äî see
                        how much we‚Äôve changed! üòä In my story, there were lots of ups and downs. Some of you might
                        relate to it, and some might be lucky enough to have a good, happy relationship üçÄ.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since childhood, I‚Äôve been a sensitive, stubborn, and sometimes aggressive person ‚Äî but also
                        very extroverted with the people close to me. During school, I didn‚Äôt go there to study much
                        (haha), but rather to have fun, argue, gossip, and flirt with my classmates. I had many friends,
                        but only a few were truly real ones.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At that time, most of my friends had boyfriends or girlfriends. I loved watching their little
                        arguments and their love ü•π. I wished for someone who would love me, marry me, and even share
                        the same surname ‚Äî someone who would come to my house and ask my parents for my hand (my cute
                        little delusional dream üí≠).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In class, I used to flirt with boys (so embarrassing now!), and after completing my HSLC in
                        2022, I enjoyed my vacation while worrying about where to continue my studies. I eventually
                        joined what I‚Äôd call the worst higher secondary school ‚Äî but honestly, I loved the life of a
                        higher secondary student.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It was the first time I stayed in a hostel, far from my family. Luckily, my cousin was there
                        too. Our parents dropped us off, and even though I thought my dad would come back to see me
                        later, he didn‚Äôt ‚Äî and that made me a little sad. Still, I made new friends, met kind teachers
                        who truly cared for us, and even the grandmother who cooked our meals loved everyone dearly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One day, I suddenly started reconnecting with my old classmates. I often called one of my
                        friends to ask about her day and her studies. She told me she was doing well and had good
                        friends ‚Äî I was happy for her. One day, I asked her to conference in a guy I liked, but he
                        didn‚Äôt respond. I felt bad and thought he was showing attitude. Later, I asked her for his
                        number directly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Back in school, he and I used to argue a lot ‚Äî more like enemies than friends ‚Äî but I secretly
                        liked him. So, I called him, and to my surprise, he answered. We talked for a while, and I
                        really enjoyed it. After that, I started calling him often, usually from the hostel grandma‚Äôs
                        phone since we had limited time. But even those short conversations made me happy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We started talking daily, and slowly, I fell in love with him. I was shy to confess at first,
                        but on December 31st, we talked till midnight. When the clock struck twelve, we wished each
                        other Happy New Year 2023! ‚ú®
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In February, I finally said those three magical words ‚Äî I love you. ü•∞
                        From then on, everything felt perfect. I couldn‚Äôt believe I could love someone that deeply. All
                        my friends knew about him. Those days were some of the happiest times of my life.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But as always, good days come before the bad ones...
                    </p>
