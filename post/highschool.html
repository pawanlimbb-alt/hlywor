                <div class="story-body">
                    <p>Hello!</p>
                    <p>
                        Life can be a real pain sometimes, and trust me, I've been through some stuff that might make
                        you wonder, "Whoa, can someone actually go through all that?" Yep, it's me right now, living
                        that not-so-great life. But before I spill the tea, let me introduce myself. I'm Pawan Limbu, 18
                        years old, I've somehow managed to survive this long, though I often wonder how much longer I
                        can keep going.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
                    </p>

                    <h2> So, why did I decide to write this blog?</h2>
                    <p>I've always wanted to share my story and connect with people from all over. The catch? I'm
                        terrible at expressing my feelings, and cameras freak me out. So, here I am, blogging it out.
                        IDK if anyone's even reading this, but sharing your life story isn‚Äôt a crime, right?üìù
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My childhood? Meh, nothing worth remembering. It was pretty rough, and honestly, who cares about
                        those days? Moving on.üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
                    </p>
                    <h2>School time Struggles and Regrets</h2>
                    <p>I did the whole elementary school thing, then high school. Haven‚Äôt hit college yet, so let‚Äôs see
                        what happens. But let me tell you, high school was the worst. Unlike people who say they miss
                        their high school days and friends, I‚Äôm just glad I survived that nightmare. More bad memories
                        than good, though I did make a few solid friends that I‚Äôll never forget.</p>
                    <p>High school was brutal. I always felt like, ‚ÄúWhy am I even here?‚Äù It made me feel so worthless.
                        My attendance was a joke, less than 30%‚Äîmaybe 7 days a month. And the punishments after being
                        MIA for so long? Yikes, still haunts me. I wasn‚Äôt into making friends, barely talked to my
                        classmates. Honestly, I can hardly remember them.</p>
                    <p>Oh, and guess what? I even got into a fight with a teacher. Yeah, not my finest moment. My
                        reputation tanked, and I still regret it. If I could go back, I'd undo that mess, but the past
                        is set in stone. Being a no-show at school, fighting with teachers, not taking things
                        seriously‚ÄîI was on every teacher‚Äôs wanted list. They all hated me, and honestly, I don‚Äôt blame
                        them. I was a total idiot.</p>
                    <p>So, as my final exams‚Äîthe high school leaving exams‚Äîwere coming up and the school made a
                        so-called shortlist. Not of students likely to pass, but those expected to fail (according to
                        the teachers). Surprise, surprise, my name was there. My past actions had already put me on
                        their radar. One teacher warned me, "Pawan, you‚Äôre going to fail if you don‚Äôt study for this
                        final."
                    </p>
                    <p>That stress, ugh! And then, the big day arrived‚ÄîTHE FINAL EXAMS. I was so freakin' nervous. The
                        thought of my name on that list haunted me. But somehow, I got through all the exams. The
                        results came out a month or two later, and guess what? I passed with a first division. Only a
                        few of us did. I didn‚Äôt care about the division; I was just relieved to have finished that
                        miserable high school era. I hope my passing in the first division taught the teachers a
                        lesson‚Äîdon‚Äôt judge a book by its cover.</p>
                    <p>But seriously, I want to apologize to all my teachers for being such a bad student. I'm sorry for
                        all the trouble I caused.</p>
                    <h2>Present Day Dilemmas and Future Plans</h2>
                    <p>Now, back to the present. I just completed my higher secondary school, and I'm at a crossroads. I
                        can't decide what to do next. Should I take a gap year or jump straight into college? For now,
                        I've decided to take a gap year to prepare for the engineering entrance exams. I‚Äôm aiming for
                        IIT or NIT, but let's see how things pan out. In the meantime, I'll keep blogging.</p>
                    <p>Oh, and I almost forgot to mention‚ÄîI have an Instagram account where I'm a content creator. I
                        make cover song videos, singing and playing guitar. I'm not famous or anything; I‚Äôve got around
                        200 followers and my videos get about 300 to 400 views. But I'll stay patient and consistent.
                        Let‚Äôs see what happens. And I would be happy if you follow me here is the gateway make sure to
                        followüòä. <a href="https://instagram.com/limbupaw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@limbupaw</a>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>So, that's a sneak peek into my life. Despite all the crap, I'm here, sharing my story. Maybe
                        someone out there can relate. Thanks for reading, and I hope this connects with you.

                        Farewell...!</p>
